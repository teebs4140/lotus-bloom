# Clicker Game Task Log

- Initialized task log.
- Confirmed requirements with user: build lotus-themed clicker game with HTML/CSS/JS (user said CSS) and maintain log in tasks directory.
- Outlined three-step plan: assess structure, build lotus clicker core, add upgrades and polish.
- Planned files: `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js` in project root.
- Decided UI sections: header, lotus button, stats panel, upgrades list with purchase buttons.
- Defined mechanics: manual clicks, lotus essence currency, upgrades for auto-click and click multiplier, dynamic costs.
- Created `index.html` with lotus-themed clicker layout, counters, and upgrade panel placeholder.
- Authored `styles.css` for gradient background, lotus button styling, and responsive layout.
- Implemented `script.js` core state management and click handler with bloom pulse animation.
- Updated `index.html` counters to include per-click stat and added upgrades hint text.
- Tweaked `styles.css` for new counter labels, hint styling, and maintained bloom animation.
- Rebuilt `script.js` with upgrade definitions, cost scaling, purchase handling, passive income loop, and rate recalculations.
- Adjusted upgrade cost calculation in `script.js` to round up to whole petals, preventing mismatch between displayed and required costs for repeat purchases.
- Refactored `script.js` to build upgrade cards once and update their state without rebuilding DOM, preventing interval-driven re-render glitches that blocked button clicks.
